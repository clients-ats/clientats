The rust-std component is unavailable for this target in the stable channel.\n\n## Error Message\n```\nerror: component 'rust-std' for target 'universal-apple-darwin' is unavailable for download for channel 'stable'\n```\n\nThis occurs during the \"Setup Rust\" step when attempting to install the stable toolchain with the universal-apple-darwin target.\n\n## Root Cause\n- Workflow specifies `target: 'universal-apple-darwin'` in the matrix (line 24)\n- This is not a valid Rust target triple\n- Valid macOS targets are: `x86_64-apple-darwin` and `aarch64-apple-darwin`\n- Universal binaries must be created by combining these two architectures\n\n## Proposed Solutions (in order of preference)\n\n### Option 1: Use Tauri's built-in universal binary support\nChange target to `aarch64-apple-darwin` and let Tauri handle universal binary creation\n\n**Pros:**\n- Tauri has built-in support for creating universal binaries\n- Cleaner workflow configuration\n- Single build process\n\n**Cons:**\n- Need to verify Tauri v2 automatic universal binary support\n- May require additional Tauri configuration\n\n### Option 2: Build both architectures separately\nBuild x86_64 and aarch64 separately, then use lipo to combine\n\n**Pros:**\n- Complete control over the build process\n- Guaranteed to work with current Rust toolchain\n\n**Cons:**\n- More complex workflow\n- Longer build times (two separate builds)\n- Need to handle combining binaries manually\n\n### Option 3: Change to aarch64-apple-darwin only\nBuild only for Apple Silicon and drop Intel support\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simple, single target\n- Apple Silicon is the current standard\n\n**Cons:**\n- Excludes Intel Mac users\n- Not ideal for backwards compatibility\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Research Tauri v2's universal binary support and configuration\n2. Update matrix.target from `universal-apple-darwin` to appropriate target(s)\n3. Update rustup target installation steps (lines 77-82)\n4. If using Option 1: verify tauri.conf.json has correct universal binary settings\n5. If using Option 2: add lipo step to combine binaries\n6. Update --target arg in tauri-action (line 145)\n7. Test on PR build\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] macOS build passes in GitHub Actions CI\n- [ ] Rust toolchain installs successfully on macOS runner\n- [ ] Phoenix release builds successfully on macOS\n- [ ] Tauri application compiles and bundles successfully on macOS\n- [ ] .dmg and .app artifacts are generated\n- [ ] Generated macOS binary supports both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures (universal binary)\n- [ ] All three platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) build successfully in the same workflow run\n- [ ] Changes are documented in commit message with explanation of fix\n- [ ] PR shows green checkmark for Tauri Build workflow on macOS\n\n## Testing Validation Checklist\n\n1. Push fix to PR and verify macOS build step \"Setup Rust\" passes\n2. Verify \"Build Phoenix release\" step completes on macOS\n3. Verify \"Build Tauri app\" step completes on macOS\n4. Verify macOS artifacts (.dmg/.app) are generated and uploadable\n5. Download macOS artifact and verify architectures with: `file path/to/binary` or `lipo -info path/to/binary`\n6. Expected output should show: `Mach-O universal binary with 2 architectures` or similar\n7. Verify the binary includes both `x86_64` and `arm64` architectures\n8.

{"id":"clientats-5wgt","title":"Fix esbuild 'Could not resolve phoenix-colocated/clientats' error","description":"## Problem\nThe macOS and Linux builds are failing during asset compilation with esbuild unable to resolve the import path \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\".\n\n## Error Message\n```\n✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\"\n\n  You can mark the path \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.\n\n1 error\n##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.\n```\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\nThis error occurs during `mix assets.deploy` when esbuild tries to bundle JavaScript assets. The import path \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\" is not resolving correctly. Possible causes:\n\n1. The phoenix-colocated path configuration is incorrect in esbuild config\n2. Missing alias configuration in esbuild for the phoenix-colocated import\n3. File structure issue where the referenced module doesn't exist at expected location\n4. Incorrect import statement in JavaScript files\n\n## Location to Investigate\nThe error suggests we have an import statement like:\n```javascript\nimport something from \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\"\n```\n\nThis needs to be found and fixed. Likely locations:\n- assets/js/app.js\n- assets/js/**/*.js\n- lib/clientats_web/components/**/*.js (if using colocated components)\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Fix the import path\nUpdate the import to use the correct relative or absolute path that esbuild can resolve.\n\n### Option 2: Add esbuild alias configuration\nConfigure esbuild.config.js with proper path aliases for phoenix-colocated imports.\n\n### Option 3: Mark as external\nIf this is meant to be an external dependency, configure esbuild to treat it as external (though this seems wrong for our use case).\n\n### Option 4: Remove colocated components pattern\nIf we're not actually using Phoenix colocated components, remove the import entirely.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Search codebase for \"phoenix-colocated/clientats\" import\n2. Understand what this import is supposed to load\n3. Fix the import path or esbuild configuration\n4. Test asset compilation locally\n5. Push fix and verify CI builds pass\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] esbuild successfully bundles assets without errors\n- [ ] `mix assets.deploy` completes successfully\n- [ ] Phoenix application starts with compiled assets\n- [ ] No JavaScript console errors in browser\n- [ ] Assets are correctly bundled in Tauri app\n- [ ] macOS build completes successfully\n- [ ] Linux build completes successfully\n- [ ] Windows build continues to work (no regression)\n\n## Testing Validation Checklist\n1. Run `mix assets.deploy` locally - should complete without errors\n2. Push fix and verify \"Build Phoenix release\" passes on macOS\n3. Verify \"Build Phoenix release\" passes on Linux\n4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors when app runs\n5. Verify Tauri app builds successfully on all platforms\n6. Verify artifacts are generated for all platforms\n\n## Files to Investigate\n- assets/js/app.js\n- assets/js/**/*.js (search for phoenix-colocated)\n- config/config.exs (esbuild configuration)\n- mix.exs (esbuild args)\n- esbuild.config.js (if it exists)\n\n## Search Commands\n```bash\ngrep -r \"phoenix-colocated\" assets/\ngrep -r \"phoenix-colocated\" lib/\n```\n\n## References\n- Failed build: https://github.com/clients-ats/clientats/actions/runs/20387836822\n- esbuild errors: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#resolve\n- Phoenix colocated components: https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.Component.html","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-20T02:01:26.782516-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T02:02:34.072048-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T02:02:34.072048-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed by adding 'mix compile' step before 'mix assets.deploy' in prepare-release.sh.

Windows-specific NIF compilation issue\n\n## Proposed Solutions\n\n### Option 1: Use pre-compiled bcrypt NIFs\nInstall elixir_make with pre-compilation support or use a bcrypt_elixir version with pre-compiled NIFs for Windows.\n\n### Option 2: Switch authentication library\nReplace bcrypt_elixir with pbkdf2_elixir or argon2_elixir which may have better Windows support.\n\n### Option 3: Add Windows compiler dependencies\nEnsure proper C compiler toolchain is installed in the CI environment before building.\n\n### Option 4: Use bcrypt_elixir with different compile flags\nConfigure bcrypt_elixir compilation with Windows-specific flags or use an alternative build approach.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n1. Research bcrypt_elixir Windows compatibility with OTP 26\n2. Check if newer bcrypt_elixir versions fix this issue\n3. Test chosen solution locally on Windows if possible\n4. Update dependencies or workflow configuration\n5. Verify build passes on Windows CI\n\n## Definition of Done\n- [ ] Windows CI build completes \"Build Phoenix release\" step successfully\n- [ ] bcrypt_elixir compiles without errors on Windows\n- [ ] Authentication still works correctly with any library changes\n- [ ] All dependencies install successfully on Windows\n- [ ] Phoenix server starts successfully on Windows\n- [ ] Tauri build completes on Windows\n- [ ] Windows artifacts (.msi/.exe) are generated\n- [ ] macOS and Linux builds continue to pass (no regression)\n\n## Testing Validation Checklist\n1. Push fix and verify \"Build Phoenix release\" step passes on Windows\n2. Check that bcrypt_elixir or replacement library compiles successfully\n3. If library was changed: verify authentication tests pass\n4. Verify Phoenix server starts in the build\n5. Verify Tauri build completes\n6. Verify Windows artifacts are created\n7. Run all three platform builds to ensure no regression\n\n## Files to Investigate/Modify\n- mix.exs (possibly update bcrypt_elixir version or switch library)\n- .github/workflows/tauri-build.yml (possibly add compiler dependencies)\n- config/*.exs (if switching auth library)\n\n## References\n- Failed build: https://github.com/clients-ats/clientats/actions/runs/20387836822\n- bcrypt_elixir: https://github.com/riverrun/bcrypt_elixir\n- Related issue: https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/issues/153","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-20T02:01:26.348035-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-20T02:02:34.479923-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-20T02:02:34.479923-05:00","close_reason":"Fixed by adding ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd@v1 action to Windows build workflow.
